## Greedy algorithms
+ A special case of **dynamic programming**
  + At each **decision** point, choose **immediate** gains
+ Relies on **greedy choice** property:
  + **Locally** optimal choices &rArr; **global** optimum
+ Not all problems have greedy choice property:
  + **Hybrid** strategies use large **jumps** to get to right "hill",
  + Then use greedy **hill-climbing** to get to the top

---
## Problem-solving outline
+ Describe optimial **substructure** (e.g., via *recurrence*)
+ Convert to naive **recursive** solution
  + Could then convert to **dynamic programming**
+ Use **greedy choice** to simplify recurrence
  + So only **one** subproblem remains
  + Don't have to **iterate** through all subproblems
  + Need to **prove** greedy choice yields *global* optimum
+ Convert to **recursive** greedy solution
+ Convert to **iterative** (bottom-up) greedy solution
